                I'm a front-end web developer. I love to build things, encounter problems to solve, and collaborate ideas with others.
                    {/* My dream is to become a web developer and build fantastic websites! I started learning how to code from scratch on December 13th 2019, when I spent half my savings on a new laptop and programming books. 

I've taken a big leap of faith on pursuing a new career  in programming because I love learning and creating.

 I've worked as an estate agent letting properties, at McDonald flipping burgers, Starbucks serving hot coffees, as a Personal Trainer shaping bodies, a gym membership salesmen selling the dream body, a professional athlete living on peanuts, and a home carer taking care of those in need. 

I'm sure for those of you who have worked in as many fields as me, understand when you find something you love to do, consider yourself lucky!

 Since I started to learn code, I've enjoyed every single minute of it and to turn this love of code into a job one day would be a dream come true. 

Join me on my adventure as I embark on my new career in  becoming a web developer!  */}
